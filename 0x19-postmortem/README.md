ssue Summary
CodeCraft, our esteemed web application, faced a notable outage. The incident affected every facet of the service, resulting in widespread user frustration marked by error messages and unresponsive pages. Around 70% of users encountered difficulties accessing the platform during this timeframe. The underlying cause was identified as a database connection issue, hindering the retrieval and display of user data.

Timelines
•	02:15 PM: The monitoring system detected the issue, triggering an immediate alert to the operations team.
•	02:20 PM: Initial attempts to resolve the issue were made by restarting the application server.
•	02:30 PM: Realizing the problem persisted, the team delved into the database logs, suspecting a potential issue with the database server.
•	02:45 PM: A misleading assumption led to the investigation of the database server's network configuration, consuming valuable time.
•	03:00 PM: As the issue persisted, attention shifted back to the application layer, specifically focusing on the database connection handling.
•	03:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the development team as database connection anomalies were identified.
•	04:00 PM: The root cause was pinpointed: a misconfiguration in the database connection pooling settings, leading to connection exhaustion.
•	04:15 PM: Corrective measures were implemented, including a fix to the misconfiguration and a graceful restart of the application server.
•	04:30 PM: CodeCraft was back online and fully operational after the corrective measures were applied.

Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of this catastrophe was identified as a database connection issue, resulting in the inability to retrieve and display user data. Eventually corrective measures were implemented, including a fix to the misconfiguration and a graceful restart of the application server
Corrective and Preventative Measure

•	Enhanced Monitoring: Strengthen monitoring to include specific alerts for database connection issues.
•	Code Review Practices: Implement regular code reviews to catch potential misconfigurations in critical settings.
•	Documentation Update: Enhance documentation on database connection pooling best practices and configurations.
